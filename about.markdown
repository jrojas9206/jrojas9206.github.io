My name is Pablo, I'm a [Mechatronic Engineer](https://www.unipiloto.edu.co/programas/pregrado/ingenieria-mecatronica/) with a [M.Sc. in Electroninc Engineering](http://www.javerianacali.edu.co/) and a [Ph.D. in Computer Science](https://edi2s.umontpellier.fr/). My studies focused on embedded systems 💻, mobile robotics 🚁, computer vision 📷 and machine learning 🤖. During my professional career, I have mainly worked on the development and design of electronic devices for agricultural applications, computer vision pipelines for plant phenotyping 🍃, and the application of machine learning to tasks such as segmentation and classification using RGB, multispectral (📷, 🛩️,🛰️), thermal ( ✈️ ), and LiDAR point clouds ( 🌲, 🏛️ ) to solve problems in robotics (obstacle detection, visual servoing), agriculture (leaf disease detection, fruit counting, pest detection, variable estimation), and production lines (defects detection), web item and candidate recommendation, and the application of LLMs/RAGs to human resource tasks.

I love reading science fiction novels (🤖, 👽), drawing plants 🥀, rodents🐁 and rabbits 🐇, playing guitar, coding 🧑‍🔬 for fun and teaching (programming, physics or calculus, spanish). 

My mother tongue is Spanish, I'm proficient in English and French, I also speak Portuguese (but I'm a bit rusty), and I'm also learning Russian.
