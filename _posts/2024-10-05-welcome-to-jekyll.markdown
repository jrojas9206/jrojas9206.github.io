# My first publication!!! 🫣

I'm starting this site because, for about a month now 📆, I've been thinking about sharing some of the projects and skills I've developed over the years. I also want a place to save 📖 and share specialized notes 🧑‍🏫 for students and other professionals interested in robotics, computer vision, embedded systems, and machine learning.

I'm also very interested in learning to use Jekyll and this incredibly useful space that GitHub offers to all of us. For now, you will find this small dot in the vast space of the internet to be quite simple, but I will be working to make it more interesting every week from now on.

In my plans for this site, I'll start with simple projects and theories, gradually increasing the complexity with each post. This will constitute a virtual technical diary.

Additionally, I want to highlight that if you feel I can collaborate with you on a project or publication, don't hesitate to write to me. If you see something that can be improved or is incorrect, please reach out, but be clear and provide a reference to ensure that the correction is accurate. In previous blogs and posts, I've noticed that people often judge without providing arguments or references. From my point of view, we always need to justify and prove that what we are saying is correct.

If you've read this far, thank you. I hope the words, code, and images I share in this space will be useful to you and contribute to your path or work.

Have a great day.

Best regards,

Pablo
