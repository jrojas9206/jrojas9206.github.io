## Introduction 

In this section you will find posts related to the projects I have developed and released. My goal is to publish a new project and its documentation every two weeks, usually on weekends, as I am currently working late and cannot complete the posts any faster.

Each project will generally be developed as a single package or library in Python, C++, or Java, depending on the flavor of the week.

The Python projects are structured as follows:

```
ğŸ“¦repo
 â”£ ğŸ“‚notebook
 â”ƒ â”— ğŸ“œdemo.ipynb
 â”£ ğŸ“‚src
 â”ƒ â”£ ğŸ“‚project_name
 â”ƒ â”ƒ â”£ ğŸ“œmodule.py
 â”ƒ â”ƒ â”— ğŸ“œ__init__.py
 â”ƒ â”— ğŸ“‚test
 â”ƒ â”ƒ â”— ğŸ“œtest_module.py
 â”£ ğŸ“œ.gitignore
 â”£ ğŸ“œpyproject.toml
 â”£ ğŸ“œREADME.md
 â”— ğŸ“œrequirements.txt
```

The C++/Java projects will structured as follows:

```
ğŸ“¦repo
 â”£ ğŸ“‚inc
 â”ƒ â”— ğŸ“œexample.hpp
 â”£ ğŸ“‚src
 â”ƒ â”ƒ â”£ ğŸ“œexample.cpp
 â”ƒ â”— ğŸ“‚test
 â”ƒ â”ƒ â”— ğŸ“œexample.cpp
 â”£ ğŸ“œ main.cpp
 â”£ ğŸ“œ.gitignore
 â”£ ğŸ“œCMakeLists.txt
 â”£ ğŸ“œREADME.md
 â”— ğŸ“œrequirements.txt
```
